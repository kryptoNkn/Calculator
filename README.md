## About project
I decided to start creating my own GUI calculator to explore the WinForms platform. The project is not complicated, but I spent 2 whole days on it due to my laziness :3

## Update from 11.10.2024
I fixed the bug with incorrect text input. Added new functions such as: logarithm, natural logarithm, logarithm to the base 10, sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, square root. Also made the interface more pleasant, and the API more correct.
